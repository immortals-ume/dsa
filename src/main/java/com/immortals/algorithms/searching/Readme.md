# DSA - Searching Algorithms

These algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.
The following Algorithms will be covered :

      <li>Binary Search</li> 
      <li>Ternary Search</li>
</ol>

### Linear Search Algorithm (<a href="LinearSearch.java">Linear Search</a>)

    Sequential searching algorithm which iterate over set of elements present in the array until the target is found .<br>
    If Found:  returns the element with the index m otherwise false<br>
    Time complexity: O(N).
    Auxiliary Space: O(1).

### Binary Search Algorithms (<a href="BinarySearch.java">Binary Search</a>)

    Implemented in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.   <br>
    Time Complexity: O(log n)
    Auxiliary Space: O(1)

### Ternary Search Algorithms (<a href="TernarySearch.java">Ternary Search</a> )

     Implemented in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in three.  <br>
     Time Complexity: O(log3n)
     Auxiliary Space: O(log3n)
